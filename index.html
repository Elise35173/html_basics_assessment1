                <p>Taronga Zoo Sydney houses more than 4,000 animals both native and exotic, including gorillas, tigers, leopards, chimpanzees, giraffes, Australian sea lions, kangaroos and koalas. Once you’ve been up close with the animals, experience the wildlife from a new perspective by tackling the treetop Wild Ropes which is more than 60 high rope challenges over four courses. This includes zip-lines, rope climbs and suspended bridges. For the ultimate sleepover, book the Roar and Snore experience, allowing you to stay in sarafi-style tents at the zoo and encounter animals up close.</p>

If what happens off-stage intrigues you, sign up for a two-hour backstage tour, which takes guests behind-the-scenes into the exclusive domain of performers, with a full cooked breakfast in the green room. Tours operate daily at 7am. To cap it all off, dine overlooking the harbour at Peter Gilmore’s restaurant Bennelong - one of Australia's most awarded fine dining restaurants.</p>
